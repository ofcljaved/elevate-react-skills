# React + TypeScript | Props

In this project, I have gained valuable insights into the proper handling of props in React while incorporating TypeScript. This approach not only enhances the developer experience by providing intelligent code suggestions but also minimizes the potential for errors â€“ a primary objective when working with TypeScript.

One notable aspect of this project is the explicit definition of prop types within each component. This practice greatly improves code quality and robustness. Here's a sample snippet illustrating this concept:

```typescript
interface CardProps {
  username: string;
  btnText?: string;
}

const Card = ({ username, btnText = "View Profile" }: CardProps) => {
  return (
    // ...code
  );
};
```

Furthermore, to streamline the development process and focus primarily on functionality rather than design, I opted to utilize the [Devui.io](https://www.devui.io/) component library. This choice allows for efficient component integration and promotes the development of feature-rich applications.

By incorporating these practices and technologies, this project underscores the importance of utilizing TypeScript with React, ultimately resulting in cleaner and more robust codebases.
