# React + TypeScript | TODO App

This Todo application leverages the Context API and localStorage for efficient data management. While it may appear simple at first glance, developing it provides valuable lessons on writing code effectively, passing data, and harnessing the power of context in a meaningful manner.

This project has significantly enhanced my understanding of the Context API, making me feel confident in building a wide range of applications. By implementing best practices, such as creating an index file in each folder and importing from there, we ensure clean and organized code. Additionally, the use of TypeScript plays a crucial role in debugging and reducing errors, as it provides predefined and strongly-typed structures throughout the project.
